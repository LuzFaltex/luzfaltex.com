<p>Please read these General Staff Guidelines thoroughly. This document was last updated 18 June 2021.</p>

By accepting any volunteer position with LuzFaltex, each individual acknowledges and agrees that they are not considered an employee of LuzFaltex and acknowledge and agree that that to the extent that they ever make any claim that they were employed by LuzFaltex they will stipulate that any such relationship was "at will" and that they are or were not entitled to any wages or monetary consideration for any of their volunteer duties.</p>
<p>By agreeing to act as a volunteer for the purposes of LuzFaltex, each individual acknowledges and agrees as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are personally responsible for protecting their health and they waive any claim that they make that their duties as a volunteer were the cause of any adverse health condition they may suffer while performing their volunteer duties;</li>
<li>They have an affirmative duty to follow any guidelines issued by the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex regarding safe health practices; and</li>
<li>They have an affirmative duty to follow any Federal, State, or Local Governmental Health Regulations that may be in place during their association with LuzFaltex.</li>
</ul>
<p>These General Staff Guidelines may include references to certain benefits that the volunteers may enjoy by performing the duties of their volunteer position. By agreeing to act as a volunteer for the purposes of LuzFaltex, each individual acknowledges and agrees that in the event that circumstances occur that are outside of the control of the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex that such benefits may not be provided. Each individual acknowledges and agrees that this document does not provide any guarantee of any benefit and that the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex has the complete discretion to withdraw any benefits referred to in these General Staff Guidelines on a group or individual basis.</p>
<h1 id="luzfaltex-management-guidelines">LuzFaltex Management Guidelines</h1>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Management Staff must commit to overseeing their team and completing all tasks assigned to them.</li>
<li>Management Staff will keep a log of all official business conducted by them.

<li>Management Staff must attend all staff meetings or provide a notice of absence at least 24 prior to the scheduled meeting date and time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="director-expectations">Director Expectations</h2>
