            <h1 id="general-staff-guidelines">General Staff Guidelines</h1>
<p>Please read these General Staff Guidelines thoroughly. This document was last updated 18 June 2021.</p>
<p>These General staff Guidelines are intended solely as a guide. They do not, in any way, shape, or form constitute a contract of employment. By accepting any volunteer position with LuzFaltex, each individual acknowledges and agrees that they are not considered an employee of LuzFaltex and acknowledge and agree that that to the extent that they ever make any claim that they were employed by LuzFaltex they will stipulate that any such relationship was "at will" and that they are or were not entitled to any wages or monetary consideration for any of their volunteer duties.</p>
<p>By agreeing to act as a volunteer for the purposes of LuzFaltex or any of its projects, each individual acknowledges and agrees as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are personally responsible for protecting their health and they waive any claim that they make that their duties as a volunteer were the cause of any adverse health condition they may suffer while performing their volunteer duties;</li>
<li>They have an affirmative duty to follow any guidelines issued by the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex regarding safe health practices; and</li>
<li>They have an affirmative duty to follow any Federal, State, or Local Governmental Health Regulations that may be in place during their association with LuzFaltex.</li>
</ul>
<p>These General Staff Guidelines may include references to certain benefits that the volunteers may enjoy by performing the duties of their volunteer position. By agreeing to act as a volunteer for the purposes of LuzFaltex or its Projects, each individual acknowledges and agrees that in the event that circumstances occur that are outside of the control of the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex that such benefits may not be provided. Each individual acknowledges and agrees that this document does not provide any guarantee of any benefit and that the Board of Directors of LuzFaltex has the complete discretion to withdraw any benefits referred to in these General Staff Guidelines on a group or individual basis.</p>
<h1 id="luzfaltex-director-and-assistant-director-guidelines">LuzFaltex Director and Assistant Director Guidelines</h1>
<p>These guidelines apply to Directors and Assistant Directors of any Project department, the Project Manager, and all other members of the Board of Directors.</p>
<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors must be 18 years of age or older.</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors must commit to overseeing their sector, managing staff, and completing all tasks assigned to them.</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors will keep a log of all official business conducted by them. Emails are logged by the system, but phone calls and in person contacts require a log stating the time and date of the conversation, the name of the person contacted, the subjects discussed, and any further follow-up as needed.</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors must attend all staff meetings or provide a notice of absence at least 24 prior to the scheduled meeting date and time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="director-expectations">Director Expectations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Directors or Assistant Directors will be provided with or create their own timeline of tasks to be completed and deadlines for their completion. Tasks are expected to be completed by the established deadlines. Directors/Assistant Directors are expected to anticipate deadlines and ask for information from other departments in a reasonable amount of time to complete the tasks before deadlines.</li>
<li>Directors or Assistant Directors will contact their Project Manager and their staff at least once a month.</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors must maintain their LuzFaltex email assigned to them by LuzFaltex IT. Email will be checked at least twice a week.
<ul>
<li>Any email exchanges with people concerning LuzFaltex or your assigned Project must be sent or transmitted using the LuzFaltex email system. Directors or Assistant Directors should never give personal emails as a contact for matters relating to LuzFaltex or any of its Projects. Additionally, correspondence through the LuzFaltex email system should not cover excessively personal matters.</li>
<li>Directors or Assistant Directors may forward emails from their LuzFaltex-issued account to their own email accounts. However, all email replies will be sent with the official email account and not the personal forwarded email account.</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors will use a password aligning with our password policy.</li>
<li>Barring any litigation holds, a retention policy of 30 days is applied to all email messages. Directors and Assistant Directors will be expected to save an offline copy of any important emails which need to be preserved for longer than 30 days. Offline copies should be saved to the cloud storage system, not to personal devices.</li>
<li>After being informed of a litigation hold, Directors and Assistant Directors agree that they will not attempt to delete, hide, or otherwise remove access to any emails contained within their email box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Directors and Assistant Directors must respond to emails and/or other official communications in no more than 7 days' time.</li>
<li>Directors or Assistant Directors should not create or take on the additional tasks of another department or division unless approved by the Director/Assistant Director of the other department and the Project Manager.

<li>If a Director or Assistant Director knows they are no longer able to fulfill the duties of their role, they will contact their Project Manager in writing and resign their volunteer position. A decision will be made at that time concerning any benefits due to the staff member based on tasks completed (as evidenced by logs and other written materials). Duties will be reassigned by the Project Manager, not the Director/Assistant Director. Although a Director/Assistant Director may recommend a replacement, LuzFaltex is not bound to comply.</li>

<li>Any information shared or conversations conducted in meetings or email should be considered private and confidential Directors or Assistant Directors may not share that data with anyone who is not a member of the proper level of organization, nor allow any third parties access to confidential information.

This includes event announcements and project planning details. It also includes releasing information to players, staff, and other individuals excluding other Directors or Assistant Directors, the Project Managers, or the Board.</li>
<li>LuzFaltex must protect the personal information of its staff and players. Personal information should not be shared with third parties at any time without prior written approval from the Board of Directors.</li>
<li>If a Director or Assistant Director receives a request for information that is not available on the website or social media, the Director or Assistant Director will forward the request to the appropriate Director and the Project Manager. If a Director is unclear on what information has been released for their own department, they will contact their Project Manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conflict-and-disagreement">Conflict and Disagreement</h2>

<li>If a Director or Assistant Director has a disagreement with their Project Manager, they should bring the issue up with the Chief Operating Officer.</li>
